# Basic Rock-Paper-Scissors Extended Game 

This is a Python implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game, extended to include two additional options: Lizard  and Spock . The game is played between a human player (Player 1) and the computer (CPU). 

## The rules of the game are based on the following logic: 

        Rock  crushes Scissors  and smashes Lizard
        Scissors  cuts Paper  and decapitates Lizard
        Paper  covers Rock  and disproves Spock
        Lizard  poisons Spock  and eats Paper
        Spock  vaporizes Rock  and smashes Scissors
     

## How to Play 

### Run the script in a Python environment.
        python rpy.py

### When prompted, enter your choice:
        rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock.
        
### The CPU will randomly select one of the five options.

### The game will determine the winner based on the rules above.

### If you want to quit the game at any time, type q.
